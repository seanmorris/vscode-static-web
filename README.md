## Usage

Pull the code & build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanmorris/vscode-static-web.git
cd vscode-static-web
make
```

## Start the dev server

```bash
make serve
```

## Creating an extension

Create a new directory inside `extra_extensions` and use [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) to scaffold your extension:

```bash
cd extra_extensions
npx --package yo --package generator-code -- yo code
```

***Important!***
Make sure to open up your package.json, and copy the `main` key to `browser`.
Otherwise, your extension will not run on the web version of VS Code.

```json
{
    "main": "./dist/extension.js",
    "browser": "./dist/extension.js", // <== This one
}
```

Once you're ready to run your extension, just hit ctrl+c in your terminal and run

```bash
make all serve
```

... and refresh the page.
